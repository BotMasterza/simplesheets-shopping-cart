## Getting Started

The documentation---what little there is---is available here: http://bradonomics.com/simplesheets-shopping-cart/

The main things you will need to change are the Google Sheets URI and the Paypal email address in the main.js file.

### What's in the download?

The download includes all the HTML, CSS and JS files you'll need to run the shopping cart. You can [download the files from GitHub](https://github.com/bradonomics/genesis-boilerplate/archive/master.zip) (or clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/bradonomics/genesis-boilerplate.git`) and have a fully functioning shopping cart in minutes.
